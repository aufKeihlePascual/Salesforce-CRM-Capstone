# Tours and Travels Platform Development Using CRM-Salesforce

## Project Overview
The Tours & Travels Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application is a Salesforce-based system designed to optimize and automate the core operations of a travel agency. It consolidates key business functions such as customer relationship management, travel package handling, booking and payment processes, employee role assignments, as well as feedback collection into a unified platform. The most significant aspect of this CRM is its use of Salesforce’s no-code and low-code development tools— such as Flows, Process Builder, and Declarative Configuration— to build complex logic and automation without the need for extensive traditional coding.
<br/>
In turn, these tools enabled developing features like guided customer onboarding, real-time booking confirmations, and automated follow-up communications all while maintaining adaptability and ease of future updates. Custom code using Apex (Classes, Triggers, Batch Apex, Scheduled Apex, and Future methods) were used for handling advanced automation and personalized communications. In addition, the system allows for tailored reports and dashboards that support data-driven decision-making, as well as strict data access control and validation through user permissions. Overall, these components form an end-to-end solution that enhances operational efficiency and customer engagement.
